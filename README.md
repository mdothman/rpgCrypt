#rpgCrypt
-I would like to first make a couple of points about this assignment.
    1. There are many resources to pull from when you want to create a random password generator, and there seem to be many different ways to do one.
    2. When it comes down to what I have to do in order to make something work there is actually a minimal amount of coding that I want to do. 
    3. There is only one way to avoid the many problems of software bugs, and that is logic bound code.
    4. Have a code that is minimal in function and optimal in logic. 

edit: I had no idea what I was talking about when I made this. I had a lot of trouble understanding javascript because it was hard remember what everything did, and what the purpose was for, and I didn't know that there was only certain things that I could do under particular circumstances. I googled a lot, and for the most part got this working through sheer willpower. I copied this code from a youtube video https://youtu.be/duNmhKgtcsI. I followed along until I couldn't get past a certain bug. 

    Once I went through the code, and did some google research I figured out exactly what had went wrong and got the rpg working :D. This project was a lot of fun, and I can't wait to improve even more on my craft.
