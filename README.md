-I would like to first make a couple of points about this assignment.
    1. There are many resources to pull from when you want to creat a random password generator, and there seem to be many different ways to do one.
    2. When it comes down to what I have to do in order to make something work there is actually a minimal amount of coding that I want to do. 
    3. There is only one way to avoid the many problems of software bugs, and that is logic bound code.
    4. Have a code that is minimal in function and optimal in logic.
